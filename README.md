# Welcome to Zine Machine

This is a handy little template for creating zines that you can read online and
also print! CSS Grid and print stylesheets means you will automatically get a
print layout that you can fold up to create a little book. Amazing!

🔍 You can jump straight to the finished zine which includes the folding
instructions by going to: [zine-machine.glitch.me](https://zine-machine.glitch.me)

👨‍💻 You can look at the HTML that powers that in
[`index.html`](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/zine-machine?path=index.html)

👩‍💻 There's an empty zine that you can use as a template in the conveniently named
[`template.html`](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/zine-machine?path=template.html)

♻️ So, go ahead and remix the project then show me what you create 💙
