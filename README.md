# Welcome to Zine Machine

This is a handy little template for creating zines that you can read online and
also print! CSS Grid and print stylesheets means you will automatically get a
print layout that you can fold up to create a little book. Amazing!

🔍 You can jump straight to the finished zine which includes the folding
instructions by going to: <https://zine-machine.glitch.me>

👨‍💻 You can look at the HTML that powers that in `index.html`.

👩‍💻 There's an empty zine that you can use as a template in the conveniently
named `template.html`.

♻️ So, go ahead and remix the project then show me what you create 💙
