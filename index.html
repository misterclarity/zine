    <h1>What's a zine?</h1>
    <p>Zines are little, self-produced publications with a history going back to the 1920s. People used zines to share
      the content they were passionate about with others and over the years that's been everything from sci-fi,
      feminism, and rock music. As access to photocopiers and later printers became more widespread, creating a zine was
      an easy option for almost anyone.</p>
