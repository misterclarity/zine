    <h1>What's a zine?</h1>
    <p>Zines are little, self-produced publications with a history going back to the 1920s. People used zines to share
      the content they were passionate about with others and over the years that's been everything from sci-fi,
      feminism, and rock music. As access to photocopiers and later printers became more widespread, creating a zine was
      an easy option for almost anyone.</p>

      <b>Q:</b> How do we combine these worlds?<br>
      <b>A:</b> With the power of CSS!</p>

      You will need to set the page to landscape and make sure there's no margins or scaling. We want to print on the
      edge, baby! You should see a preview laid out like this:</p>

    <p>The key things we need here are CSS Grid and a print-specific layout. Conveniently, Rachel Andrew (<a
